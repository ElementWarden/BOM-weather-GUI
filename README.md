# BOM-weather-GUI
This is a base GUI to view and project weather information from the Bureau of Meterology (BOM). 

When you run the application you must provide the API key that you want to read from. Once you have entered the API key it will display current weather projections, updating every 10 minutes.


Additional work:
- Move servos based on temperature and precipitation chance
